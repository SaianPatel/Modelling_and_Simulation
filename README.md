# Modelling_and_Simulation

In this repository you will fidn the necessary notebooks for the 3 model iterations discussed in my report within the Zombie Models folder.

Iteration 1: A basic HZR model where zombies die naturally.

Iteration 2: A refinement of iteration 1 where humans can attack zombies.

Iteration 3: A closed loop system in which 'Turned' zombies can resurrect from the dead and attack normal zombies before becoming humans again.

Some example solvers are in the Solvers folder but I used NDSolve only.

The notebooks in the Legacy folder are various (poorly written) iterations of models I explored throughout this term.
